## Performance Considerations

The current architecture has several performance implications:

- **Content-addressable storage**: Enables efficient deduplication. Uses SHA-256 for IDs; the probability of hash collisions is negligible for practical purposes and is likely not explicitly handled.
- **Tree structure (DAG)**: Allows for partial replication and sparse checkouts (via tip-based operations). Tip calculation in `InMemoryDatabase` appears to involve checking parent lists across entries, potentially leading to \(O(N^2)\) complexity in naive cases, though optimizations might exist. Diff calculations (not explicitly implemented) would depend on history traversal.
- **`InMemoryDatabase`**: Offers high speed for reads/writes but lacks persistence beyond save/load to file. Scalability is limited by available RAM.
- **Lock-based concurrency (`Arc<Mutex<...>>` for `Database`)**: May become a bottleneck in high-concurrency scenarios, especially with write-heavy workloads. Needs analysis. <!-- TODO: Analyze lock contention points. Consider alternative concurrency models (e.g., lock-free structures, sharding) for future development. -->
- **Height calculation and topological sorting**: The `InMemoryDatabase` uses a BFS-based approach (similar to Kahn's algorithm) with complexity expected to be roughly \(O(V + E)\), where V is the number of entries and E is the number of parent links in the relevant context.
- **CRDT merge algorithm**: Uses a recursive LCA-based algorithm with automatic caching that significantly improves performance for complex DAG structures.
  <!-- TODO: Add benchmarks or profiling results if available. -->
  <!-- TODO: Discuss potential optimizations, e.g., caching, indexing strategies (if applicable). -->

### CRDT Merge Algorithm Performance

The **recursive LCA-based merge algorithm** provides significant performance improvements through intelligent caching:

#### Algorithm Complexity

- **Base Case**: \(O(1)\) for cached states (most common after initial computation)
- **LCA Finding**: \(O(H \cdot P)\) where H is height and P is number of parents
- **Path Merging**: \(O(D \cdot M)\) where D is DAG depth and M is merge operation cost
- **Overall**: Amortized \(O(1)\) due to caching, worst-case \(O(D \cdot M)\) for uncached states

#### Caching Benefits

- **Cache Hit Rate**: Near 100% for repeated queries of the same state
- **Memory Efficiency**: Cache keys `(Entry_ID, Subtree)` provide precise targeting
- **No Invalidation**: Immutable entries eliminate cache invalidation overhead
- **Monotonic Growth**: Cache only grows as new entries are added

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Complex DAGs**: Recursive approach handles diamond inheritance patterns efficiently
- **Optimized Path Finding**: Single `get_path_from_to()` call replaces multiple separate path computations, reducing database calls and improving deduplication
- **LCA Computation Optimization**: Avoids redundant LCA calculations within the same recursive call
- **Concurrent Access**: Cache reduces computation load, improving concurrent read performance
- **Memory vs. Computation Trade-off**: Uses memory to cache computed states, drastically reducing CPU for repeated access
- **Scalability**: Algorithm scales well with DAG complexity due to memoization

#### Lock Contention Considerations

The caching system introduces additional database interactions:

- Cache lookups and updates require database locks
- However, the dramatic reduction in computation complexity offsets lock overhead
- Future optimizations could include read-through caches or lock-free cache structures
