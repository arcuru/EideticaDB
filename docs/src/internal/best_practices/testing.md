# Testing Best Practices

This document outlines testing patterns and practices used in the Eidetica codebase, focusing on integration testing, test organization, and comprehensive validation strategies.

## Testing Architecture

### 1. **Integration-First Testing Strategy**

Eidetica uses a single integration test binary approach rather than unit tests, organized in `tests/it/` with modules mirroring the main codebase structure.

**Key principle**: Test through public interfaces to validate real-world usage patterns.

### 2. **Test Module Organization**

Each test module mirrors the main codebase structure, with `mod.rs` for declarations, `helpers.rs` for utilities, and separate files for different features.

### 3. **Comprehensive Test Helpers**

The codebase provides helper functions in `tests/it/helpers.rs` for common setup scenarios and module-specific helpers for specialized testing needs.

## Authentication Testing Patterns

The auth module provides specialized helpers for testing authentication scenarios, including key creation macros, permission setup utilities, and operation validation helpers.

## Permission Testing

Test authentication and authorization systematically using the auth module helpers to verify different permission levels and access control scenarios.

## CRDT Testing

Test CRDT properties including merge semantics, conflict resolution, and deterministic behavior. The crdt module provides specialized helpers for testing commutativity, associativity, and idempotency of CRDT operations.

## Performance Testing

Performance testing can be done using criterion benchmarks alongside integration tests. Consider memory allocation patterns and operation timing in critical paths.

## Error Testing

Comprehensive error testing ensures robust error handling throughout the system. Test both error conditions and recovery scenarios to validate system resilience.

## Test Data Management

Create realistic test data using builder patterns for complex scenarios. Consider property-based testing for CRDT operations to validate mathematical properties like commutativity, associativity, and idempotency.

## Test Organization

Organize tests by functionality and use environment variables for test configuration. Use `#[ignore]` for expensive tests that should only run on demand.

## Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Overly complex test setup** - Keep setup minimal and use helpers
- **Testing implementation details** - Test behavior through public interfaces
- **Flaky tests with timing dependencies** - Avoid sleep() and timing assumptions
- **Buried assertions** - Make test intent clear with obvious assertions

## Summary

Effective testing in Eidetica provides:

- **Integration-focused approach** that tests real-world usage patterns
- **Comprehensive helpers** that reduce test boilerplate and improve maintainability
- **Authentication testing** that validates security and permission systems
- **CRDT testing** that ensures merge semantics and conflict resolution work correctly
- **Performance testing** that validates system behavior under load
- **Error condition testing** that ensures robust error handling and recovery

Following these patterns ensures the codebase maintains high quality and reliability as it evolves.
