# Best Practices

This section documents established patterns and guidelines for developing within the Eidetica codebase. Following these practices ensures consistency, performance, and maintainability across the project.

## Overview

The best practices documentation covers:

- **[API Design Patterns](api_design.md)** - Guidelines for string parameters, conversion patterns, and performance considerations
- **[Module Organization](module_organization.md)** - Code structure, dependency management, and module design patterns
- **[Error Handling](error_handling.md)** - Structured error types, error propagation, and error handling strategies
- **[Testing](testing.md)** - Integration testing, test organization, and comprehensive validation strategies
- **[Performance](performance.md)** - Hot path optimization, memory efficiency, and scalable algorithms
- **[Security](security.md)** - Authentication, authorization, cryptographic operations, and secure data handling
- **[Documentation](documentation.md)** - Documentation standards, API documentation, and writing guidelines

## Core Principles

All best practices in Eidetica are built around these fundamental principles:

### 1. **Performance with Ergonomics**

- Optimize for common use cases without sacrificing API usability
- Minimize conversion overhead while maintaining flexible parameter types
- Use appropriate generic bounds to avoid double conversions

### 2. **Consistency Across Components**

- Similar operations should have similar APIs across different modules
- Follow established patterns for parameter types and method naming
- Maintain consistent error handling and documentation patterns

### 3. **Clear Intent and Documentation**

- Function signatures should clearly communicate their intended usage
- Parameter types should indicate whether data is stored or accessed
- Performance characteristics should be documented for critical paths

### 4. **Future-Ready Design**

- Backward compatibility is **NOT** required during development
- Breaking changes are acceptable for both API and storage format
- Focus on correctness and performance over compatibility at this stage

## Quick Reference

### For New Contributors

Start with these essential guides:

1. **[Module Organization](module_organization.md)** - Understanding code structure and dependencies
2. **[Error Handling](error_handling.md)** - How errors work throughout the system
3. **[Testing](testing.md)** - Writing and running tests effectively
4. **[Documentation](documentation.md)** - Writing good documentation and examples

### For API Development

Focus on these areas for public API work:

1. **[API Design Patterns](api_design.md)** - String parameters and method design
2. **[Performance](performance.md)** - Hot path optimization and memory efficiency
3. **[Security](security.md)** - Authentication and secure coding practices

### For Internal Development

These guides cover internal implementation patterns:

1. **[Module Organization](module_organization.md)** - Internal module structure and abstractions
2. **[Performance](performance.md)** - CRDT algorithms and backend optimization
3. **[Testing](testing.md)** - Integration testing and test helper patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing new features or modifying existing code:

1. **Review existing patterns** in similar components
2. **Follow the established conventions** documented in this section
3. **Add comprehensive tests** that validate the patterns
4. **Document the rationale** for any deviations from established patterns
5. **Update documentation** to reflect new patterns or changes

## Contributing to Best Practices

These best practices evolve based on:

- Lessons learned from real-world usage
- Performance analysis and optimization needs
- Developer feedback and common patterns
- Code review discussions and decisions

When proposing changes to established patterns, include:

- Rationale for the change
- Performance impact analysis
- Updated documentation and examples
